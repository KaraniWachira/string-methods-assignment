# This repo contains my solution to this string methods assignment at The Jitu cohort 14

Question 1:
A string is a palindrome if it is read the same from forward or backward. For example, dad reads the same either from forward or backward. So the word dad is a palindrome. Similarly, madam is also a palindrome. Write a JavaScript function to determine whether a given string is a palindrome.

Question 2:
Write a function to check whether two given strings are anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are an anagram of each other.

Question 3:
Write a JavaScript function to check whether a string is blank or not.

Question 4:
Write a JavaScript function that hides email addresses to prevent unauthorized access.
Test Data :
console.log(protect_email("robin_singh@example.com"));
"robin...@example.com"

Question 5:
Write a JavaScript function to reverse words in a given string.
Test Data :
("abc") -> "cba"
("JavaScript Exercises") -> "tpircSavaJ sesicrexE"
(1234) -> "It must be a string."
